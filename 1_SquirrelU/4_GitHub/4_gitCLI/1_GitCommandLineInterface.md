## Introduction

This module takes a look at Git commands. By practicing these commands, you will 
be able to better understand the essential Git concepts so that you can maximize 
your productivity with Git/GitHub. You will execute Git Commands from a bash 
shell. 

![](../images/terminal.png){: .image}

## Prerequisites

* After setting up your Squirrel environment, you should have already updated the
  IntelliJ terminal to utilize the bash shell. For instructions on how to do
  this, consult the **Change IntelliJ Terminal** section of **Setting Up Squirrel in IntelliJ** for assistance. 

## Git Configuration

![]({{ site.github.url }}/images/gitlogo.png){: .right}

Use the ```git config``` command to work with your settings stored as follows: 

Git stores and sets configurations at various levels (each subsequent level 
overrides the previous level): 

  Level        | Location       | Contents                                             | Command to set scope |
  --------     | ---------      |------------                                          |--------------        |
  System       | /etc/gitconfig | Configurations for every user and all repositories   | ```git config --system```  |
  User         | ~/.gitconfig   | Configurations specific to user                      | ```git config --global```  |
  Repository   | .git/config    | Configuration specific to that single repository     | ```git config```           |
  

Verify that **user.name** and **user.email** have been set in your global 
configuration by IntelliJ by executing the following command in your 
terminal:  

```shell 
$ git config --list  
``` 

![](../images/gitconfig.png){: .image}

Use ```git config --global user.name <Name>``` and   
```git config --global user.email <email>``` to set them if they haven't been set: 

```shell 
$ git config --global user.name "Joe Squirrel"
$ git config --global user.email jSquirrel@squirrelworks.com
``` 

## Aliases
Aliases provide a way to shorthand commands in the CLI.  
Place any desired aliases in the \[alias\] section of your **{HOME_DIRECTORY}/.gitconfig** file.  

Although you'll likely spend most of your time in IntelliJ, some of the aliases 
below may be useful tools for you. For more detail, checkout: 
<http://durdn.com/blog/2012/11/22/must-have-git-aliases-advanced-examples/>. 

**Basic Commands**  
cp = cherry-pick  
st = status -s  
cl = clone  
cm = git commit -m  
co = checkout  
br = branch   
diff = diff --word-diff  
dc = diff --cached  
fall = fetch -all  
logtree = log -graph -oneline -decorate -all  

**Reset Commands**  
r = reset  
r1 = reset HEAD^  
r2 = reset HEAD^^  
rh = reset --hard  
rh1 = reset HEAD^ --hard  
rh2 = reset HEAD^^ --hard  

**Stash Commands**  
sl = stash list  
sa = stash apply  
ss = stash save  
 
**Log List Commands**  
ls = log --pretty=format:"%C(yellow)%h%Cred%d\\ %Creset%s%Cblue\\ [%cn]" --decorate  
ll = log --pretty=format:"%C(yellow)%h%Cred%d\\ %Creset%s%Cblue\\ [%cn]" --decorate --numstat  
lnc = log --pretty=format:"%h\\ %s\\ [%cn]"  
lds = log --pretty=format:"%C(yellow)%h\\ %ad%Cred%d\\ %Creset%s%Cblue\\ [%cn]" --decorate --date=short  
ld = log --pretty=format:"%C(yellow)%h\\ %ad%Cred%d\\ %Creset%s%Cblue\\ [%cn]" --decorate --date=relative  
le = log --oneline --decorate  
filelog = log -u  

**Finding Files and Content**  
fl = log -u  
dl = "!git ll -1"  
dlc = diff --cached HEAD^  
dr  = "!f() { git diff "$1"^.."$1"; }; f"  
lc  = "!f() { git ll "$1"^.."$1"; }; f"  
diffr  = "!f() { git diff "$1"^.."$1"; }; f"  
grep = grep -Ii  
gr = grep -Ii  
la = "!git config -l | grep alias | cut -c 7-"  
done = "!f() { git branch | grep "$1" | cut -c 3- | grep -v done | xargs -I{} git branch -m {} done-{}; }; f"  
  
## Git Command Line Interface (CLI)  
For our work here, we will utilize the Git CLI, through the use of the git command.  
You will utilize the git command for everything you do.  
For more information, type ```git --help``` or ```man git```

### Create a Repository
1. Go to your GitHub page:   https://github.com/yourUserName 

2. Go to the Repositories tab   

3. Click on the new button and provide the basic information:   

![](../images/createRepository.png){: .image}

TODO: MM I think something is missing here...there isn't any command listed

### Clone
Use ```git clone https://github.com/yourUserName/yourRepository``` to clone 
a copy of the repository onto your local machine 

```shell 
$ git clone https://github.com/zippyzsquirrel/squirrel-u
```

### Create 'origin' and 'upstream' Links

To create an 'origin' link, use 
```git remote add origin https://github.com/yourUserName/yourRepository``` 
  
To create an 'upstream' link, use 
```git remote add upstream https://github.com/yourUserName/yourRepository``` 

```shell 
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/jusr/squirrel-u
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/jusr/squirrel-u
```  

To verify remotes have been correctly created:

```shell 
$ git remote show origin
$ git remote show upstream
```  

You should see your repository in the Fetch and Push URLs:  
    Fetch URL: https://github.com/**yourUserName/yourRepository.git** 
    Push URL:  https://github.com/**yourUserName/yourRepository.git** 

If you make a mistake, you can easily remove these remotes and redo the above 
steps with:   

```shell 
$ git remote remove origin
$ git remote remove upstream
```  

### View Repository Status

You can view current status of your repositories by using this command: 

```shell 
$ git status
```  

![](../images/gitstatus.png){: .image}
          
### Modify, Add, Commit

Using the ```git status``` command, we can see the files that have been modified, 
but are *not* staged for commit: 

![](../images/gitCommands_01.png){: .image}

Stage a modified file with the ```git add <filename>``` command

```shell 
$ touch myfile.js  
$ git add myfile.js
```  

Comparing the image above to the example below, you can see that the file in the 
```git add`` command has been moved from the **Changes not staged for commit** 
(modified files) section to the **Changes to be committed** (staged) section 

![](../images/gitCommands_02.png){: .image}

Commit a staged file with the ```git commit -m "message text" <filename>``` command

```shell 
$ git commit -m "updating something" myfile.js
```  

You can see after the commit via ```git status``` that your branch is now one  
commit ahead of origin (remember that the commit command only moves files from 
the Staging Area to the .git Directory, it does NOT have any affect on the 
repositories living in GitHub). 

![](../images/gitCommands_03.png){: .image}

If you don't see any benefit from using the staging step, you can combine add and  
commit steps with ```git commit -a <file>```. 

```shell 
$ git commit -a myfile.js
```  
 
*IntelliJ sidenote:* In IntelliJ, the add and commit steps are combined. 
However, you can always use the CLI as an alternative if you need the separate 
functionality. 

### Reset
On occasion, you will want to undo files that you've committed, but not pushed. 
This is done via reset. 
 
There are several options for reset, which determine what happens to files after 
they are reset. All reset modes reset the HEAD to <commit>. 

  * **soft** Leaves all your changed files as "Changes to be committed". Doesn't  
    touch the working directory tree or index file (staging area). See "Squashing  
    Commits" below. 
  * **hard** Any changes to tracked files in the working tree since <commit> are 
    discarded. Resets the index and working tree. 
  * **mixed** (default) the changed files are preserved but not marked for 
    commit. Resets the index but not the working tree and reports what has not 
    been updated. 
  * **merge** keeps files which are different between the index and working tree 
    (i.e. which have changes which have not been added).  
    Resets the index and updates the files in the working tree that are different   
    between <commit> and HEAD.  
    If a file that is different between <commit> and the index has unstaged 
    changes, reset is aborted. 
  * **keep** Resets index entries and updates files in the working tree that are 
    different between <commit> and HEAD. If a file that is different between 
    <commit> and HEAD has local changes, reset is aborted. 
  
Reset can be beneficial for undoing a bad commit. It is recommended in this case 
to use a ```git reset -hard``` 
  
Another alternative for altering the history of a bad commit is [amend](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/rewriting-history).  
```shell 
git commit --amend 
```   

Lets you combine staged changes with the previous commit instead of committing it   
as an entirely new snapshot. 

**Squashing Commits** 
Squashing is the technique of taking prior multiple commits 
and undoing them into your staging area so that when you push your code to your 
Fork, you are only making one commit history. 

This can be beneficial if you are in the habit of incrementally committing 
changes and then doing one big push later on. To accomplish this, you would use 
the **soft** reset option. 

The downside of squashing commits is that you lose your history of all your 
prior commits, which may be beneficial for isolating problems.  

### Push Changes to Your Public Fork

```shell 
 $ git push {remote} 
```  

Now verify that your changes have made it to github.com/**userName** fork.

### Fetch, Merge, Pull
It is important to stay current with any upstream changes from members of your 
team. 

To do so, you can use ```git fetch``` to import commits from a remote repository  
into your local repo. These commits are stored as remote branches, giving you the  
opportunity to review changes before integrating them into your copy of the  
projects.  

```shell 
$ git fetch
```  

Then, use ```git merge``` to merge these changes into your local repository.

```shell 
$ git merge
```  

Alternatively, you can complete both fetch and merge in a single ```git pull <remote> <branch>``` command

```shell 
$ git pull upstream master
```  

### Create Branch

Branches are one way to organize multiple sets of work. By creating alternate 
branches from the master branch and making commits to them, you can switch 
between work streams and those changes will be preserved on the branch. Branches 
can also be useful for gathering work that you may want to share in a Pull 
Request with another user. 

```git checkout -b <new-branch>``` creates a new branch with the name you specify  
and makes that branch the current branch. 

In the following example, we are creating new branch called "myfeature" and 
modifying a file (junk) within that branch. Then, we are committing that change 
with a message of "test2" 

```shell 
$ git checkout -b myfeature  // creates new myfeature branch  
$ touch junk 
$ git commit -a -m "test2" junk  
```

### Delete Branch

Make sure you are not currently on the branch you would like to delete, otherwise you will get an error.

```git branch -d <branch-name>``` deletes the specified branch name

In the following example, we are deleting a branch called "myfeature"

```shell
$ git branch -d myfeature // deletes myfeature branch
```

### Switch Branch and Merge

Use ```git checkout <existing-branch>``` to switch to a specified branch.

In the example below, we are switching to the "master" branch and merging changes    
from the "myfeature" branch. As always, we can get the status of our repositories   
with ```git status``` to verify changes. 

```shell 
$ git checkout master  // switch back to master branch  
$ git merge myfeature  // take commits into master branch  
$ git status           // verify changes  
``` 
 
```shell 
$ git merge featureA —no-ff   // no fast forward 
$ git branch -D featureA 
$ git push origin :featureA 
``` 

### Rebasing

An alternative to merge is to rebase, which basically replays all the history 
changes onto your branch.  
For more detail: <http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing> 

### Stashing

Stashing takes the dirty state of any modified tracked files and staged changes 
of your working directory and saves it on a stack of unfinished changes that you 
can reapply at any time. 

```shell 
$ git stash        // push your modified and staged changes onto the stash stack   
$ git status       // your changes are gone  
$ git stash list   // view your stashes   
$ git stash apply  // reapply from stash  
$ git status       // your changes are back   
```

![](../images/gitStash_02.png){: .image}

![](../images/gitStash_04.png){: .image}

For more options in working with Stash:  <http://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-Tools-Stashing>

### Setting Up Remote Branches

If you'd like to track a remote branch:

```shell 
$ git branch --set-upstream-to master origin/master 
$ git checkout -b abc --track upstream/master
```

### Ignore Whitespace in Merges

```shell 
$ git merge -Xignore-space-change whitespace
```  

### Set Tracked Files to Not Be Committed

Mark files that are tracked to be ignored so that changes won't be committed 
using ```git update-index --assume-unchanged <file>``` 

```shell 
$ git update-index --assume-unchanged config/database.yml
```  

You can unmark the file as ignored with ```git update-index --no-assume-unchanged <file>```

```shell 
$ git update-index --no-assume-unchanged config/database.yml
```

### Notifications - Web or Email
By specifying another user who wasn't in the original pull request with an @user 
mention, they will from that point be included in the pull request chain and any 
notifications. They can unsubscribe from that Pull Request if they'd like to.
